Thankyou for downloading KinMS!

This package should include KinMS.pro (which is required, along with the IDL astrolibrary). It also includes a test suite, and two files associated with this in a separate folder.

The test suite contains various commented examples, which should show you some ways you can use the KinMS code. Each is explained in detail in the header to the procedure. Please open the KinMS_testsuite.pro file to view these, and try them.

If you find this software useful for your research, I would appreciate an acknowledgment to the use of the "KINematic Molecular Simulation (KinMS) routines of Davis et al., (2013)".

If you find any bugs, or wish to be kept up to date when new versions of this software are released, please email me at DavisT -at- cardiff.ac.uk

Many thanks,
